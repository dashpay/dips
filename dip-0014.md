# Abstract

This Document expands the derivation ability set by BIP32 to allow for derivation on paths using
256-bit unsigned integers.

# Motivation

Derivation paths defined in BIP32 are limited to 31-bit children. The original reasoning seems to be
mostly from the use case of BIP32. It seems unattainable to use more than 2<sup>31</sup> (Over 2
billion) addresses in a wallet. However if we need a unique child in a derivation path, this cannot
be achieved with 31-bit children. We need unique children in DashPay derivation paths. Unique
children can be defined as 2 random indexes that have less than 2<sup>128</sup> chance of being the
same. As 256-bit derivation paths might be useful for other applications, we believe the solution
presented within merits its own document.

  Wallets](https://github.com/dashevo/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

  Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)

# Compatibility

One fundamental aspect of this document is backwards compatibility with BIP32 derivation. If a child
key’s index is less than 2<sup>32</sup>-1 then the resultant child key created by the derivation
outlined in this document will match the derivation outlined in BIP32.

# The Dashpay Example

Derivation in BIP32 is limited to 31 bits (the 32nd bit is used to mark hardening). If we limited
ourselves to 31-bit derivations we would be faced with the following problem: we need the derivation
path between user A and user B to be unique and be made in such a way that a user C could never
create an attack to have the same address space as given to B from A.

To illustrate the attack let’s assume we used only 31-bit derivation. Since user A and user B’s
unique id is public, any form that reduces the entropy of this relationship to 31 bits per child
would be attackable. For example, if we used the last 31 bits of the unique id for each user to make
the tail of the derivation path then user C could cycle through ~2<sup>31</sup> Blockchain
Identities and eventually find one that would match. This would easily be achievable with an ASIC
miner. User C would then receive the same extended public key as user B and therefore be able to
know when payments were made from User B to user A. More complicated schemes also suffer the same
problem as User C could replicate any known function to create the same 31 bits.

To solve this we allow derivation of paths on 256-bit unsigned integers matching the Identity’s
registration hash.

The derivation path for Dashpay relationships is discussed more in depth in the DashPay
Implementation Proposal. Here we will focus on the last two 256-bit derivations. The derivation path
will look like:

`m(userA)/9’/5’/15’/0’/(userA’s unique id)/(userB’s unique id)`

Deconstructed that is :

* 9 hardened / See DIP9
* 5 hardened / Coin type
* 15 hardened / Feature
* 0 hardened / Account
* userA’s unique id (not hardened)
* userB’s unique id (not hardened)

Making the last two fields non-hardened allows for an extended public key that covers all address
spaces of all our contacts for all our blockchain identities. This can be used for accounting and
also to create the friend requests without having to use a private key.

# Specification: Key derivation

We will modify the following to the original specification as described in
[BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#conventions).

## Conventions

As standard conversion functions, we assume:

* ser<sub>256</sub>(i): serialize a 256-bit unsigned integer `i` as a 32-byte sequence, most
  significant byte first.

## Extended Keys

In the original BIP32 specification, each extended key had 2<sup>31</sup> normal child keys and
2<sup>31</sup> hardened child keys. We extend that specification to now allow 2<sup>256</sup> normal
child keys and 2<sup>256</sup> hardened child keys. Each of these child keys has an index. In the
original specification, a key was hardened if the most significant bit of the index was set. Instead
we now use a Boolean `h` to represent if a child key is hardened. Hence now both normal child keys
and hardened keys will use indices 0 through 2<sup>256</sup>-1.

## Child Key Derivation (CKD) Functions

Given a parent extended key and an index `i`, it is possible to compute the corresponding child
extended key. The algorithm to do so depends on whether the child is a hardened key or not, if the
index is less or more than 2<sup>31</sup>, and whether we're talking about private or public keys.

### Private parent key → private child key

The function CKDpriv256((k<sub>par</sub>, c<sub>par</sub>), i, h) → (k<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)
computes a child extended private key from the parent extended private key:

* Check whether i &lt; 2<sup>32</sup> (whether we should use compatibility mode) and check if `h` is
  true (whether the child is a hardened key).
  * If (i&lt; 2<sup>32</sup>) :
    * If hardened child (h==true): let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data = 0x00 ||
      ser<sub>256</sub>(k<sub>par</sub>) || ser<sub>32</sub>(i)). (Note: The 0x00 pads the private
      key to make it 33 bytes long.)
    * If normal child: let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data =
      ser<sub>P</sub>(point(k<sub>par</sub>)) || ser<sub>32</sub>(i)).
  * If (i>=2<sup>32</sup>) :
    * If hardened child (h==true): let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data = 0x00 ||
      ser<sub>256</sub>(k<sub>par</sub>) || ser<sub>256</sub>(i)). (Note: The 0x00 pads the private
      key to make it 33 bytes long.)
    * If normal child: let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data =
      ser<sub>P</sub>(point(k<sub>par</sub>)) || ser<sub>256</sub>(i)).
* Split I into two 32-byte sequences, I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>R</sub>.
* The returned child key k<sub>i</sub> is parse<sub>256</sub>(I<sub>L</sub>) + k<sub>par</sub> (mod
  n).
* The returned chain code c<sub>i</sub> is I<sub>R</sub>.
* In case parse<sub>256</sub>(I<sub>L</sub>) ≥ n or k<sub>i</sub> = 0, the resulting key is invalid,
  and one should proceed with the next value for `i`. (Note: this has a probability lower than 1 in
  2<sup>127</sup>.)

The HMAC-SHA512 function is specified in [RFC 4231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4231).

### Public parent key → public child key

The function CKDpub256((K<sub>par</sub>, c<sub>par</sub>), i, h) → (K<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)
computes a child extended public key from the parent extended public key. It is only defined for
non-hardened child keys.

* Check if `h` is true, if it is then return failure.
* Check whether i &lt; 2<sup>32</sup> (whether we should use compatibility mode).
  * If it is (compatibility mode): let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data =
    ser<sub>P</sub>(K<sub>par</sub>) || ser<sub>32</sub>(i)).
  * If not (UInt256 mode): let I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c<sub>par</sub>, Data =
    ser<sub>p</sub>(K<sub>par</sub>) || ser<sub>256</sub>(i)).
* Split I into two 32-byte sequences, I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>R</sub>.
* The returned child key K<sub>i</sub> is point(parse<sub>256</sub>(I<sub>L</sub>)) +
  K<sub>par</sub>.
* The returned chain code c<sub>i</sub> is I<sub>R</sub>.
* In case parse<sub>256</sub>(I<sub>L</sub>) ≥ n or K<sub>i</sub> is the point at infinity, the
  resulting key is invalid, and one should proceed with the next value for `i`.

## Serialization Format

Extended public and private keys are serialized as follows:

If (child number &lt; 2<sup>32</sup>) follow serialization format as described in BIP32 :

* 4 byte: version bytes (mainnet: `0x0488B21E` public, `0x0488ADE4` private; testnet: `0x043587CF`
  public, `0x04358394` private)
* 1 byte: depth: 0x00 for master nodes, 0x01 for level-1 derived keys, ....
* 4 bytes: the fingerprint of the parent's key (0x00000000 if master key)
* 4 bytes: child number. This is ser<sub>32</sub>(i) for i in x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>par</sub>/i,
  with x<sub>i</sub> the key being serialized. (0x00000000 if master key)
* 32 bytes: the chain code
* 33 bytes: the public key or private key data (ser<sub>P</sub>(K) for public keys, 0x00 ||
  ser<sub>256</sub>(k) for private keys)

Because of the choice of the version bytes, the Base58 representation will start with `xprv` or
`xpub` on mainnet, `tprv` or `tpub` on testnet.

If (child number >= 2<sup>32</sup>) then serialize the following way :

* 4 byte: version bytes (mainnet: `0x02FD9CD5` public, `0x02FD9CEA` private; testnet: `0x02FDA7E8`
  public, `0x02FDA7FD` private)
* 1 byte: depth: 0x00 for master nodes, 0x01 for level-1 derived keys, ....
* 4 bytes: the fingerprint of the parent's key (0x00000000 if master key)
* 1 byte: hardening: 0x00 if not hardened, 0x01 if hardened
* 32 bytes: child number. This is ser<sub>256</sub>(i) for i in x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>par</sub>/i,
  with x<sub>i</sub> the key being serialized. (Only zeros if master key)
* 32 bytes: the chain code
* 33 bytes: the public key or private key data (ser<sub>P</sub>(K) for public keys, 0x00 ||
  ser<sub>256</sub>(k) for private keys)

Because of the choice of the version bytes, the Base58 representation will start with `dpms`
(dashpay mainnet secret) or `dpmp` (dashpay mainnet public) on mainnet, `dpts` (dashpay testnet
secret) or `dptp` (dashpay testnet public) on testnet or devnets.
