These changes are considered to be against the spirit of MarteXcoin. Even if ''all'' MarteXcoin users decide to adopt any of these changes, the resulting cryptocurrency can no longer be considered "MarteXcoin" because it has diverged too much from the original design.

=== Require unanimous consent ===

These changes require the consent of every martexcoin-holder:
* Increasing the total number of issued martexcoins beyond '''21 million'''. Precision may be increased, but proportions must be unchanged.
* Any rule that adds required, explicit centralization. For example, a change requiring that all blocks be signed by some central organization.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency) Demurrage] (deletion or reassignment of coins judged to be "lost" or "unused").  This is highly controversial in the context of currency units; on the other hand it is absolutely essential for namespace entries like [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitDNS Namecoin] (which implements Demurrage for namespace entries but not for currency units).

=== Require miner consensus ===
* Changing the martexcoin distribution algorithm such that the subsidy at any given time period is decreased without miner consensus and 3 years notice, or increased beyond improved precision of halving (lossy beginning with block 1,890,000).

=== Fundamental Principles===

All changes and upgrades to the protocol should strive to maintain and reinforce these [Principles-of-MarteXcoin.mediawiki Principles of MarteXcoin]

* '''21 million coins.'''     
* '''No censorship:''' Nobody should be able to prevent valid txs from being confirmed.
* '''Open-Source:''' MarteXcoin source code should always be open for anyone to read, modify, copy, share.
* '''Permissionless:'''  No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc).
* '''Pseudonymous:''' No ID should be required to own, use MarteXcoin. 
* '''Fungible:''' All coins are equal and should be equally spendable.
* '''Irreversible Transactions:''' Confirmed blocks should be set in stone. Blockchain History should be immutable.

=== Disputed ===
* Some disputes can be resolved with community participation or through governance.
