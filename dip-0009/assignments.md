## Registered Features

Here is a table of current feature paths and any associated DIP. Future DIPs may introduce more types.


| Feature Index * | Feature | DIP Number and Name | Note |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- | ---- |
| `3'` | Masternode Keys | [DIP 0003: Deterministic Masternode List](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) | The masternode related keys are located in the following sub-paths:  <br>`0'/*` - _Reserved_<br>`1'/*` - Voting Key<br>`2'/*` - Owner Key<br>`3'/*` - Operator Key<br>`4'/*` - [Platform P2P Key](../dip-0028.md#calculating-the-platform-node-id) (ED25519)<br><br>For example, the first voting key for Dash would be at `m/9'/5'/3'/1'/0` |
| `4'` | CoinJoin Keys | CoinJoin | The masternode related keys are located in the following sub-paths:  <br>`0'/0/*` - Account 0 (external)<br>`0'/1/*` - Account 0 (change, not typically used)<br><br>For example, the first key of Account 0 for CoinJoin would be at `m/9'/5'/4'/0'/0/0`.<br><br>The main purpose of this using this path is to segregate CoinJoin-related keys from the BIP44 paths that are used to receive coins and change.  CoinJoin derivation paths may require different lookup or gap values than the BIP44 paths that have much less transaction activity.  Additionally, it may be possible to prune used keys from the BIP37 bloom filters used by mobile apps.|
| `5'` | Identity Keys | [DIP 0013: Identities in Hierarchical Deterministic wallets](../dip-0013.md) | The related keys are located in the following sub-paths: <br>`0'/key type'/identity index'/key index'/*` - Identity Authentication ([details](../dip-0013.md#identity-authentication-keys))<br>`1'/*` - Identity Registration Funding ([details](../dip-0013.md#identity-registration-funding-keys))<br>`2'/*` - Identity Topup Funding ([details](../dip-0013.md#identity-top-up-funding-keys))<br><br>For example, the first Identity Registration Funding key for Dash would be at `m/9'/5'/5'/1'/0` |
| `15'` | DashPay - Incoming Funds | [DIP 0015: DashPay](../dip-0015.md#dashpay-incoming-funds-derivation-path) | The related keys are located in the following sub-paths: `/0'/account'/*`<br><br>For example, incoming funds for the first identity would be at `m/9'/5'/15'/0'/*` |
| `16'` | DashPay - Auto Accept Proof | [DIP 0015: DashPay](../dip-0015.md#auto-accept-proof-autoacceptproof) | The related keys are located in the following sub-paths: `16'/expiration timestamp'`<br><br>For example, the key for a proof expiring at a Unix epoch time of `1605927033` would be at `m/9'/5'/16'/1605927033'` |

Note: all DIP 0009 paths are of the format: `m / 9' / coin_type' / feature' / *`

\* Where applicable, the feature index matches the number of the DIP that defines the feature(s)
