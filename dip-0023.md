## Abstract

This DIP aims to introduce an improved hard fork activation mechanism that includes both masternodes
and miners while also ensuring sufficient upgrade time is available to partners.

## Motivation

Currently, we utilize a heavily modified version of BIP-9 for hard fork activation in Dash Core. In
the previous version of Dash Core, this calculation took into account the percentage of both miners
and masternodes that had upgraded. However, since the introduction of the Deterministic Masternode
List, the activations have purely been based on miner signalling.

## Previous Work

* [BIP-0009: Version bits with timeout and
  delay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)
* [Dash dynamic activation thresholds](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/3692)

## Current System

The current system declares a start timestamp. The first block of `height % 4032 == 0` with a
timestamp greater than the start timestamp begins the first signalling cycle. Each signalling cycle
has a threshold that must be met in order for the hard fork to lock-in. In our modified BIP-9 style
activation, this threshold decreases at an exponential rate (slow at first then accelerating) from
80% down to 60% after 10 cycles have passed. In any cycle, if the final percentage of blocks
signalling is greater than the threshold, the activation is locked in. Then after another cycle
completes, the hard fork activates.

This system has a number of problems. First, it is actually problematic if the miners upgrade faster
than the masternodes. This could lead to a situation where the miners fork, yet masternodes create
ChainLocks on the “legacy” fork. In practice this has never been an issue, but it could be. Second,
it is possible that this system results in very quick upgrades and forks (as quick as only 2 weeks)
which are disruptive for services utilizing Dash. In practice this has resulted in the developers
setting the start timestamp to a month or two after the release.

## New System

**Stage 0:** Miners signal without any effect on consensus. It is impossible to lock-in at this
point. The purpose of this signalling is to enable monitoring of which miners have upgraded their
software and get an idea of the adoption rate. Additionally, it is important to note that this
signalling does not take up any space, and as such there is no incentive to minimize the time where
signalling is done.

**Stage 1:** Any valid `LLMQ_400_85` produces a `mnhfsignal` message to signal that the masternode
network has been upgraded. Since this is done by the `LLMQ_400_85` quorum, it will in effect only
occur once 85% of the masternode network has upgraded to this version. Once this message has been
created, it should be included in a block as a zero fee special transaction, similar to quorum
commitments. This can be done by any miner in any block, but it should only be included once. For
testnet the `LLMQ_50_60` quorum should be used instead.

The `mnhfsignal` message should look like:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| versionBit | uint8_t | 1 | The version bits associated with the hard fork |
| quorumHash | uint256 | 32 | Hash of the quorum signing this message |
| sig | CBLSSig | 96 | BLS signature on `version` by a public key associated with the quorum referenced by `quorumHash` |

The payload of the Masternode Hard Fork Signalling Transaction (the new special transaction with type=7) should have the following format:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| version | uint_8 | 1 | Commitment special transaction version number. Currently set to 1. Please note that this is not the same as the version field of the `mnhfsignal` message |
| commitment | mnhfsignal | 129 | This equals the payload of the `mnhfsignal` P2P message

**Stage 2:** Once this `mnhfsignal` message has been mined, two parameters are set:
`masternode_activation_height` and `min_activation_height`. The cycle beginning at
`masternode_activation_height` is the first cycle where miner signalling matters. Its starting
height is calculated based on the `mnhfsignal` message height as shown here:

    masternode_activation_height = mined_height - (mined_height % 4032) + 4032

This cycle’s threshold is `nThresholdStart` (the maximum threshold value). Each subsequent cycle
will see its threshold decreased until it reaches `nThresholdMin` (the minimum threshold value).

Regardless of miner signalling, activation only occurs once the height defined by the
`min_activation_height` parameter is met. This is set to be 6 signalling windows (~6 weeks) after
the `masternode_activation_height`. It is calculated as shown here:

    min_activation_height = masternode_activation_height + 4032 * 6

If the threshold is met at the end of a cycle, `activation_height` is calculated by each node as
shown here:

    activation_height = max((height + 4032), min_activation_height)

## Timeout

A certain timeout block height will be specified at the implementation of the hard fork to indicate
the height at which the deployment is considered failed. If a `mnhfsignal` message is not included
in a block with a height less than the timeout block height, the hard fork is deemed to have timed
out and cannot be activated.

Similar to BIP-9, a later deployment using the same bit is possible as long as its timeout block
height is higher than the previous one's timeout or activation height. This is discouraged until
necessary, and even then it is recommended to have a pause in between to detect buggy software.
